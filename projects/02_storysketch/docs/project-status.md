   - Created test scripts for Ollama connectivity

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README
   - Added detailed setup guide
   - Created Ollama integration documentation
   - Documented project structure

### In Progress

1. **Backend Development**

   - Initial model definitions
   - LLM service implementation
   - Configuration management

2. **Frontend Scaffolding**
   - Basic React application structure
   - Route definitions
   - Component structure planning

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Database Setup**
   - Implement database connection
   - Create migration scripts
   - Set up Sequelize models and associations

2. **Authentication System**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Create middleware for protected routes

3. **Core Story Generation**
   - Complete the story generation controller
   - Implement story saving and retrieval
   - Add story editing capabilities

### Short-term Goals

1. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Develop the story creation wizard
   - Implement the story library view
   - Create the story editor interface

2. **Image Generation**
   - Integrate with image generation API
   - Implement image prompt creation
   - Add image-text alignment verification

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for backend services
   - Create integration tests for LLM functionality
   - Set up frontend testing

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Export Functionality**
   - Implement PDF export
   - Add Google Slides integration
   - Create digital reading format

2. **User Management**
   - Add user profiles
   - Implement story sharing
   - Create organization/team features

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize LLM prompt efficiency
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Add background processing for long-running tasks

## Technical Debt and Considerations

1. **LLM Limitations**
   - Local LLMs may have quality limitations compared to cloud APIs
   - Need to handle cases where generation quality is insufficient
   - Consider fallback options for complex prompts

2. **Resource Requirements**
   - Local LLM usage requires significant system resources
   - Need to provide clear hardware recommendations
   - Consider offering cloud LLM options for users with limited hardware

3. **Content Safety**
   - Local LLMs may have fewer safety guardrails
   - Need robust content filtering and moderation
   - Consider implementing additional safety checks

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Core infrastructure and LLM integration
- **Phase 2**: Basic story generation and management functionality
- **Phase 3**: Image generation and enhanced UI
- **Phase 4**: Export functionality and advanced features
- **Phase 5**: Optimization, polish, and production readiness

## Resources Needed

1. **Development**
   - Frontend developer with React experience
   - Backend developer with Node.js/Express experience
   - UX designer for educational interface

2. **Testing**
   - Access to various LLM models for comparison
   - Educators for feedback on story quality
   - Children/parents for usability testing

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Development environment with GPU for LLM testing
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Image storage solution
