### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shanojpillai/AI-Engineering-Mastery.git
   cd AI-Engineering-Mastery/projects/01_finance_assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows (Command Prompt)

6. **Transaction Queries**: Questions about recent transactions
7. **Category Analysis**: Questions about spending in specific categories
8. **Time Period Analysis**: Questions about spending over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)

### Example Questions

Here are some examples of questions you can ask the chat assistant:

- "What's my monthly income?"
- "How much do I spend each month?"
- "What's my savings rate?"
- "Give me budget recommendations"
- "What's my forecast for next month?"
- "Show me my recent transactions"
- "How much do I spend on groceries?"
- "What's my annual spending?"
- "What are my top spending categories?"
- "How much do I spend per week?"
- "Am I spending too much on entertainment?"
- "How has my spending changed over time?"

## Database Schema

The application uses an SQLite database with the following tables:

1. **users**: Stores user information
   - user_id: Integer (Primary Key)
   - name: Text
   - income: Real

2. **categories**: Stores spending categories
   - category_id: Integer (Primary Key)
   - name: Text

3. **transactions**: Stores individual financial transactions
   - transaction_id: Integer (Primary Key)
   - user_id: Integer (Foreign Key to users)
   - amount: Real
   - category_id: Integer (Foreign Key to categories)
   - transaction_date: Text (YYYY-MM-DD format)

## Forecasting Model

The application uses time series analysis to forecast future spending based on historical patterns. The forecasting model is implemented in `models/forecaster.py` and uses the following techniques:

- **Time Series Decomposition**: Separates the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with seasonal components
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Weighted averaging with exponentially decreasing weights

The model analyzes spending patterns by category and generates predictions for future months based on historical trends and seasonality.
